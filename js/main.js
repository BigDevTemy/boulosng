  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  In 1936, a gentleman by the name of Georges Boulos opened a small Jewellery business on Broad Street, Lagos Nigeria.  This small business, unknown at that time, was to be the foundations of a family empire and birth of Boulos Enterprises Limited and other subsidiaries under the umbrella of the Boulos Group.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  In 1943, Messrs Antoine & Gabriel Boulos delved into the new industry of motorcycles with business relationships developed with the Europeans.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  Boulos Enterprises Limited (BEL) was incorporated in 1964 by the Boulos brothers Anthony and Gabriel Boulos. The main focus of their business initially, was trading and incorporation of general merchandise including some brands of motorcycles from Western Europe. After a few years, they concentrated on the importation of new Suzuki motorcycles and outboard motors to Nigeria from Japan and since then it remained a leading motorcycle and outboard motors distribution company in Nigeria.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  The continued growth in Suzuki motorcycle and Suzuki Outboard motors business in later years stimulated the company to establish the first assembly plant in the country at Oregun, Ikeja Nigeria in 1969 and assembling plant for outboard motors in 1978.  It is worthy to note this was implemented at the initiative of the company as all other competitors in the country were still importing fully built up motorcycles and outboard motors  which were subsequently banned in 1978.  In the 2010, the tricycle assembly plant( Keke) was established.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  The ban of fully built motorcycles gave the company the impetus to embark on manufacturing and assembly plant. Considering the bright future of automobile business in Nigeria and state of technology, the company embarked on the construction of phased integrated motorcycles manufacturing complex located at its present 25 acre plot at Ogba Industrial Scheme Ikeja. This was done on a view to meet growth in the business and develop a real manufacturing complex which was established in 1980. The present integrated plant has an installed capacity of 150,000 units for motorcycles, over 1000 units for outboards and over 14,000 assembling per annum on a single 8-hours shift per working day.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  Most of the outboard motors are currently imported in fully built up condition from Suzuki Motors Corporation Japan, owing to the absence of import duty differential between completely knocked down (CKD) and fully built up (CBU) outboard motors in Nigeria.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction__text mt-4">
  The motorcycle plant and Tricycle plant assembling facility have their own independent service utilities backed up system.
